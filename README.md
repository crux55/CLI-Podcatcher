Hello

I made a cli podcatcher for getting pod casts. It's only the first push and honestly, it's only just a check in so I can get this onto my server to download my podcasts overnight.

Key features include:

- Adding a base URI for all podcasts to be downloaded into
- Adding a sub folder for each podcast in the config
- Setting the amount of podcasts required or -1 for all podcasts
- Not downloading a podcast if the podcast is already downloaded (the whole reason I had to start this, honestly PCD what's wrong with you how could you allow that?)
- Having podcast config in a yml file

Feel free to tell me how bad it is, I may need reminding to work on it, or just help out, either or
